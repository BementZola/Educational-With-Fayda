## Project Synopsis:
### Problem Statement
In Ethiopia, educational documents like report cards and certificates are still mainly paper-based and often lack proper verification. This makes it easy for fake certificates to circulate, misleads employers and institutions, and risks students losing vital records. Schools also face challenges in securely tracking and sharing results with trusted parties.

### Proposed Solution
FaydaEdu will provide a secure digital platform that connects schools, the Ministry of Education, students, and employers through Fayda’s trusted national digital ID. Schools can upload verified student grades and conduct records. The Ministry will review and approve this data, which will then be securely linked to each student’s Fayda ID.

Employers and universities will be able to easily verify a student’s academic achievements, skills, and certificates by scanning their Fayda ID or requesting the records online. This solution will help eliminate fake documents, simplify hiring and admissions, and strengthen trust in Ethiopia’s education system.

### Expected Outcome
By the end of this project, first we just make within sample like within web then we will build the system ,we also plan to deliver a functional early model showing how schools can upload report cards, the Ministry can verify and approve them, and employers or institutions can confirm them using Fayda ID. This prototype could serve as the foundation for a nationwide, transparent, secure, fully digital student record sysytem for future.

### Fayda’s Role
Fayda is at the core of this project. Every student record will be tied to a verified Fayda digital ID. We will use Fayda’s OIDC (OpenID Connect) to make sure all logins and data sharing are secure, reliable, and trusted.
